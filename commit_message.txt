feat: Improve chess board and analysis results UI/UX

This commit introduces several improvements to the chess board and analysis results:

- Reduced the size of the toggle switch in analysis results for a more compact look.
- Refactored the analysis results display to move the "Best Move #" label and AI info icon to a separate line, improving readability.
- Corrected the piece notation for best moves, ensuring accurate display of piece types (e.g., 'N' for knight instead of 'p').
- Synchronized the color of the "Play" button in analysis results with the corresponding SVG circle on the board for better visual consistency.
- Implemented smoother piece movement animations on the chess board by adjusting animation duration and curve, and ensuring animation settings are applied consistently.
